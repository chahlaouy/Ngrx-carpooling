Angular with Ngrx

    Angular is a popular javascript-based user interface (UI) framework

    Ngrx is an application state managment library for Angular which uses the
principles of redux and Rxjs

    Ngrx is a great addition to an angular application, but it can be difficult
to learn

    Typically, Redux is hard to grasp at first, but once understood, it is fairly easy
to work with

    The simplest examples of Rxjs are pretty easy, but mastery of RxJS is much harder
